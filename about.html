                    <p class="lead">We believe technology should be accessible to everyone, regardless of ability, circumstance, or technical expertise.</p>
                    
                    <p>One Eyed Man Labs was founded on the principle that digital accessibility isn't just a nice-to-have feature—it's a fundamental requirement for inclusive technology. Every application we develop starts with accessibility in mind, ensuring that users with disabilities have equal access to digital experiences.</p>
                    
                    <p>Our commitment extends beyond compliance with accessibility standards. We actively involve users with disabilities in our development process, creating solutions that truly meet their needs rather than simply checking boxes on a compliance checklist.</p>

                <div class="story-content">
                    <p>One Eyed Man Labs emerged from a simple observation: while mobile technology has revolutionized how we interact with the world, many applications still create barriers for users with disabilities. We saw an opportunity to change this narrative.</p>
                    
                    <p>Our name reflects both humility and determination. In a world of rapidly advancing technology, we recognize that perfect vision isn't always necessary—sometimes a different perspective reveals solutions that others might miss. We approach development with careful attention to detail, understanding that for many users, accessibility features aren't convenient additions but essential requirements.</p>
                    
                    <p>Starting with our flagship project AudioTag, we've demonstrated that accessible design doesn't mean compromising on functionality or user experience. Instead, it often leads to more intuitive and robust applications that benefit all users.</p>
